### Part 1: Working with your own Git repository
- Create a GitHub account. Create an SSH key pair and add it to GitHub. Alternatively, create a personal access token. 
- Create a new GitHub repository and clone it locally. 
- Work locally to add new content, stage the files, make a commit, and push the changes to GitHub. 
- Create develop, test and production branches. 
- Make several changes and commit to the develop branch, then merge it into the other two branches. Push the changes to GitHub. 
- When you’re done with the branch, merge it to main. Then, commit and push to GitHub.

### Part 2: Contributing to another Git repository on GitHub 
- Fork a colleague's GitHub repository. 
- Create a new branch for a new feature. 
- Make changes, commit and push the changes to your GitHub repo. 
- When you’re done, make a Pull Request with the new feature, via GitHub’s website.
-  Ask your colleague to merge the Pull Request and close the issue.
